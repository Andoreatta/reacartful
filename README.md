# React with TypeScript and C#

I'm doing this project to learn a bit more about React, because I didn't have the slightest idea about reactive front-end, but I've decided to change that, even though my line of work is different.

I've used material UI components with React even though nowadays tailwind is on the hype and the latest dotnet SDK.

Probably i'll never complete this project because it became too boring for my tastes
